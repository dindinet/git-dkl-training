  <h2>User control</h2>
    <p>
    It's time to start working a bit on the download section. We create a
    new file called <code>downloads.djhtml</code> and put in our links
    to downloadable code. We put all the downloadable stuff into a
    subdirectory called <code>static</code>: training wheels is considering
    everything in that folder as static content, so that is going to save
    us a little bit on our processing quota.
    </p>
    <p>
    At this point in time, we decide to make the site a little bit more
    personal: if a user is logged in with his gmail account, we would like
    to greet him and thank him for his interest in the application.
    </p>
    <p>
    Training Wheels provides a couple of properties that can be used in
    a document to learn more about the current user:
    <ul>
    <li><code>user</code>  represents a user object. In django, querying for
    <code>if user</code> will make a block of text only appear if a user
    is logged in.</li>
    <li><code>user.email</code> is the email address of the current user.</li>
    <li><code>user.nickname</code> is the screen name of the current user. </li>
    <li><code>is_admin</code> is true if the user currently logged in is the author 
    of this application. This can be used to render admin-only information, 
    for instance for debugging purposes.</li>
    <li><code>loginlink</code>  is a URL that can be referred to if a user should log into the application.</li>
    <li><code>logoutlink</code> takes the user to a place where he can log out of the application. </li>
    </ul>

    With this information in mind and regular Django template tags, we create
    a downloads page that differs depending on whether someone is logged in and
    who it is.
