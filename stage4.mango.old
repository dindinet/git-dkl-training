  <h2>Deploying the final product</h2>

  <p>
  It's time to put all the bits and pieces together and to deploy the
  final version, which you are browsing right now. Go to the root folder
  of the application and edit your <code>app.yaml</code> file.
  Change the name of the application in the first line from <code>aef</code>
  to the token
  that you will upload the application with. Then, use the <code>appcfg</code>
  utility to upload the site.
  </p>
  <p>
  Congratulations -- you are done!
